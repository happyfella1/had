LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF FASHION JOB

West Chester, PA - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/YUPAI-TANG/72358bc1118e6494

Working  in  the  fashion  industry  for  more  than  20  years.  I  believed  that  I  have  earned  extensive  market
knowledge and an excellent understanding of the industry. I used to own a fashion studio in Taipei for nearly
8 years, opened a couture wedding/evening line is the most important thing I accomplished. I learned every
step toward a luxury fashion goods business. Also enjoy all the complicated process to develop a new idea
from drafting to workable product. I am both good at couture and ready-to wear collections.
As a fashion designer, brand manager, buyer, my job involved quite a wide range about fashion business
management. Each job overlaps the functions of one another. Often I am doing two or three of them at the
same time. To me, these roles are very hand-on experiences where you’ll literally be executing and performing
all the responsibilities. To work for a corporate company has better environment to bring skill into full play. I
believe that there are many fashionable needs for my creativity within the fashion industry.

WORK EXPERIENCE

Embedded Software Engineer
Intel Corporation  -  King of Prussia, PA - May 2014 to Present

Responsibilities
Intel Omni-Path High Performance Computing Fabric
• Firmware lead on a joint project with Cray for the Argonne National Laboratory Aurora Supercomputer. This
project consists of creating the Board Support Package (BSP) for a Freescale ARM processor running Yocto
Embedded Linux. Tasks for this project include U-Boot support code, and Linux Device Tree file generation.
This  project  also  requires  user-space  tools  for  board  validation,  interfacing  with  the  SPI  interface  to  the
management FPGAs, and developing interfaces for communicating with the switch ASICs over I2C.
• Developed ARM microcontroller firmware for the Host Fabric Interface PCIe card that performs management
functions over SMBUS. Tasks for this project include a PLDM implementation over SMBUS and patches to
the Linux kernel that added variable offset functionality to the bit-bang I2C controller.
• Developed VxWorks device drivers for a Cypress USB to I2C bridge.
• Worked closely with hardware teams during schematic design and board layouts for the single board switch
and the enterprise-level switch offering insight on software/hardware interface feasibility.
• Member of tiger-team for initial switch ASIC power-on. During this time we systematically powered on the
ASIC beginning at board level voltage regulator programming all the way up to bringing node links up and
passing packets.

R&D Software Engineer
Engility Corporation  -  Horsham, PA - April 2010 to Present

NAVAIR Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) PMA-264/PMA-290
• Responsible for the simulation and performance analysis of acoustic signal processing routines. Analysis and
performance tests are performed in MATLAB and in a Linux environment using C++ and Intel's IPP library.
•  Part  of  a  research  team  investigating  novel  signal  detection  techniques  for  passive  and  active  sonar.
Research  tasks  include  mathematical  derivation  of  algorithms  and  performance  bounds.  Monte  Carlo
simulations of the algorithms are performed for the derivation of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curves. Additional tasks include the development of C++ based ambient noise estimation algorithms of oceanic
environments.
• Quality Assurance (QA) Lead on two products being delivered to the NAVAIR fleet. QA tasks are composed
of test plans, test procedures, and testing to validate the functionality of the product. QA project also includes
the development of a Linux based Object Oriented C++ automated test suite. The test suite communicates via
a Linux Middleware wrapper to a Common Interface that allows for message passing (subscription/publishing)
between applications.
•  Project  responsibilities  also  include  the  system  administration  and  security  audits  of  a  Linux/Windows
network.

E-MIDDAS Wireless Vital Signs Sensor
• Responsible for design of the 3rd generation E-MIDDAS medical sensor suite prototype.
• Design tasks include sensor specifications, firmware development, and circuit design.
•  Development  of  firmware  in  C  for  interfacing  and  controlling  sensors,  timing  for  data  acquisition,  data
manipulation, and bi-directional wireless transmission of sensor data via Bluetooth.
• Responsible for all phases of hardware development. Phases include schematic design, part selection, and
Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout and routing.
• Recent tasks include the design of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing routines for noise reduction
and parameter estimation. Noise reduction algorithms include adaptive filters such as Least Mean Square
(LMS), Least Squares, and Recursive Least Squares (RLS). Parameter estimation algorithms include matched
filter designs for detecting the QRS waveform that allow for the calculation of the RR Interval. A Kalman filter
is currently under investigation for state estimation of the heart rate.
• Design of a novel wireless pulse-oximeter sensor consisting of LED timing, signal acquisition, digital filtering,
and parameter estimation.
•  Development  of  a  Windows  Graphical  User  Interface  (GUI)  for  debugging  Bluetooth  communications.
Interfaces for accessing the hardware device and parsing device messages written in C++ and C#.
• Generate enterprise level documentation that describes the functional aspects of the E-MIDDAS project.
• Direct the work of technical support staff to conduct testing.

Test Engineer Intern
Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies Laboratory  -  Cherry Hill, NJ - March 2008 to November 2008

Worked  in  the  Distributed  Operations  (DisOPS)  division  of  ATL  as  part  of  a  development  team  testing  a
handheld communications device for real-time mission updates destined for military use.
• Responsible for system functionality and usability testing in an embedded environment.
• Responsible for regression testing to ensure compatibility through the software design cycle.
• Adherence to quality assurance through bug discovery and documentation.
• Performed integration tests to guarantee successful end-user functionality.
• Composed and edited technical documentation for DisOPS handheld device.

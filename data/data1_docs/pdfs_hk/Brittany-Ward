I was responsible for coming up with tasks for middle school children to complete that would display certain
soft skills that wouldn't necessarily appear on a resume. With the completion of these tasks they would earn
an electronic "badge" which they could eventually use to replace a resume or even when applying to high
schools and colleges.

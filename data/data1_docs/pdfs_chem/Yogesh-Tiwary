WORK EXPERIENCE

Associate Research Scientist and Manager
The Dow Chemical Company  -  Collegeville, PA - June 2010 to Present

Responsibilities: Research and development of novel water-based emulsion polymers for coatings industry.
As an R&D project team leader, my job functions include inventing, developing, and commercializing new
technologies, and mentoring new scientists. I am also involved in introducing new technologies and products
to global Dow technical/sales service teams and global customers.

Skills:
• Certified six-sigma green belt project leader (presently pursuing black-belt certification)
• Polymer design to meet target performance.
• Design of experiment, coatings formulation and testing, modeling, and statistical data analysis.

Achievements:
• Development and commercialization of EVOQUETM Pre-Composite Polymer Technology to enhance TiO2
scattering efficiency in coatings and reducing carbon footprint.
• Developed seven EVOQUE products for global markets.
• One granted and four filed patents on emulsion polymer technologies.

Post-doctoral Research Fellow
Fritz-Haber-Institute  -  Berlin - January 2010 to June 2010

Responsibilities: Research on understanding GaAs bulk and surfaces using atomic-scale computer modeling
and simulations. I developed new techniques to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations.

Skills: Modeling and simulation, statistical mechanics, molecular dynamics, programming, Matlab, etc.

Achievements: One journal publication.

Research Assistant
The Pennsylvania State University  -  University Park, PA - January 2006 to December 2009

Responsibilities:  Research  on  understanding,  predicting,  and  controlling  atomic  self  assembly  of  nano-
structures  during  thin-film  deposition.  I  performed  quantum-mechanical  calculations  and  developed  a  3D
kinetic Monte Carlo model to simulate and tune self assembly using innovative processing, which could be
utilized in applications such as microelectronics, catalysis, quantum computing, etc.

Skills: Quantum mechanics, Kinetic Monte Carlo, programming, Matlab, etc.

Achievements: Seven journal publications and eight conference presentations.

Process Engineer
Fairchild Semiconductor  -  Mountaintop, PA, USA - January 2008 to August 2008

Responsibilities:  Process  development  using  chemical  vapor  deposition  for  semiconductor  manufacturing
(MOSFET and photovoltaic)

Skills:  Operating  and  developing  processes  for  equipments  including  Novellus'  Concept-I/II  and  SPEED
Plasma CVD systems, KOKUSAI and TEL's LP-CVD systems, X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, etc.

Research Assistant
The University of Virginia  -  Charlottesville, VA - August 2003 to August 2005

Responsibilities: Research on mathematical modeling and simulation of pitting corrosion of stainless steel. I
developed a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model to explain sudden onset of pitting corrosion on stainless
steel, and investigated factors that influence that.

Skills: Electrochemistry, programming, mathematical modeling, numerical method, statistics, and Matlab.

Achievements: Two journal publications.

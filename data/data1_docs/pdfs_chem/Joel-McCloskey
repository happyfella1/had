WORK EXPERIENCE

Research and Development Engineer
LithChem Energy / Retriev Technologies - June 2002 to August 2015

Designed and built equipment for lab scale production of several high-purity lithium salts
used in battery applications. Developed SOPs for the laboratory production of these
materials. Scaled up production of these lithium salts from lab scale to commercial
scale, selecting process equipment and implementing techniques to allow for process
simplification and debottlenecking.
• Designed and built process systems to purify and dry solvents used in lithium battery
electrolytes. This lowered costs by purchasing standard-purity solvents and highly
purifying them as needed. Designed and built unique product crystallizer for lithium salt
production.
• Designed custom heating mantles and inert gas enclosures for lab scale chemical
reactions.
• Designed and built iris ports for inert atmosphere glove boxes, eliminating cumbersome
gloves  which  improved  manual  dexterity  and  simplified  movement  of  tools  and  materials  for  battery  cell
assembly.
• Designed and built equipment for making lithium hexafluorophosphate (most commonly
used  and  most  difficult  to  make  lithium  battery  salt),  including  designing  custom  reactors  for  handling  the
corrosive starting materials. Designed and built distillation process
equipment and spent-chemical recovery apparatus. Designed and implemented unique
final product filtration system that maximized yield and reduced process time.
Streamlined final product drying and packaging procedures. This process produced the highest purity lithium
hexafluorophosphate in the world at the time.
• Developed procedures for producing, storing, and delivering samples of the final product
battery salt and high purity battery electrolytes to customers.

lithium-ion battery electrolytes. Designed specialized equipment to
correct electrolyte processing errors to reduce acid impurities from >1,000 PPM down to undetectable levels,
making the electrolyte acceptable for use. Also designed and
marketed this device to other lithium-ion battery electrolyte manufacturers.
• Designed and built equipment for lab-scale production of several high purity quaternary
salt compounds for the ultracapacitor industry. Also provided samples of these
ultracapacitor salts and their electrolytes to customers; electrolyte sample production
ranged from one liter to several hundred liters.

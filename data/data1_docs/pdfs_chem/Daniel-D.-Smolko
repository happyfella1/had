WORK EXPERIENCE

Process Engineer & Development Specialist
Chayil Technologies LLC  -  San Diego, CA - July 2009 to October 2012

Provided  process  engineering  and  development  services  in  the  areas  of  energy,  materials  and  chemical
technologies. Developed and optimized production processes and assisted other companies in the areas of
fuels, materials and specialty chemicals. Developed and Tested Novel Routes for the Production of Chemicals,
Materials and Fuel Additives.

Developed  lightweight  instruments  for  "portable"  diagnostic  and  genetic  applications.  Managed  the
development  and  manufacture  of  instrument  mechanical  systems,  thermal  systems,  sensors  and  system
boards.  Helped  optimize  the  performance  of  instrument  mechanical,  fluidic,  thermal,  electrochemical,
electronic and other systems. Led the development of system software and optimized instrument operation
and scripts for microbe and genetic sampling, processing and detection.

Project Manager & Process Engineer
Nanogen Incorporated  -  San Diego, CA - June 1996 to July 2009

Designed, developed, fabricated and assisted in the commercialization of chemical and biological detection-
based  products,  diagnostics  and  instrumentation.  Jointly  developed  and  carried  innovative,  cutting-edge
products  to  commercialization.  Formulated  and  developed  commercially  successful  synthetic  gel  matrices
to  replace  polysaccharide  coatings  for  microarrays.  Developed  radio  frequency  plasma  surface  treatment
protocols,  investigated  chemical  surface  treatments  and  formulated  surface  chemistries  for  microarrays.
Reduced  the  variability  and  increased  analyte  signals  in  synthetic  gel-based  layers  by  several  fold  on  the
NanoChip®  100,  NanoChip®  400  and  ACV400  instruments.  Designed,  tested  and  assembled  a  reactive
polymerization process for coating hydrogels onto microarray chips used in the NanoChip® instruments and on
other platforms. Supervised and validated the installation of the reaction coating process into manufacturing.
Constructed a modified reaction coating system, and increased the yield of the new reaction coating system
by introducing changes into the process, supervised and assisted manufacturing personnel with modifications
to the existing process and assisted manufacturing personnel in improving the yield of the process from a 78%
yield to a 99.3% overall yield. Supervised the addition of more reaction coating systems into manufacturing.
Supervised, validated and approved changes to the reaction coating process, cartridge manufacturing, testing
procedures, upgrades, burn-in and shipping.

Assisted in the conception and design; and supervised and assisted with the development and manufacture of
a "next generation" instrument for DNA diagnostic applications. Supervised the development and manufacture
of instrument systems, assembly, motion controls, electronics and software. This instrument provides DNA
sample  processing,  ultrafast  DNA  amplification  and  array  based  sample  detection.  Setup,  ran,  assisted
with and supervised polymer, device and systems research, chemistry, detection and development studies.
Achieved  milestones,  analyzed  data,  organized  and  presented  results  for  projects  and  developments  in

electrochemical detection, sample processing, attachment chemistries and engineering projects. Organized
data and wrote reports for internal projects.

Process Engineer & Head Chemist
Somerset Environmental Services & Somerset Oil  -  Somerset, KY - January 1995 to March 1996

Assisted in the construction, setup and management of a hydrocarbon and environmental services laboratory
for water, soil and refinery sample testing. Supervised and instructed laboratory and field personnel in various
tests, sample collection procedures and onsite water testing. Developed software, taught laboratory personnel
and  provided  test  methods  such  as  water  and  soil  hydrocarbons,  chloride,  sulfide  and  soil  particle  size.
Developed a test procedure for analyzing hydrocarbon components, assembled laboratory databases and
developed a procedure for determining and testing octane numbers for refinery gasoline samples. Setup and
qualified a Mass Spectroscopy System for the testing of medium to high molecular hydrocarbons. Installed
the company's LAN communication network.

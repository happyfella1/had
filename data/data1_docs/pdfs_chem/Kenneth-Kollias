Electrical Engineering Manager
Boeing  -  Ridley Park, PA - November 2012 to Present

Boeing Defense Systems - Electrical Wire Installation Design Team

Technical Team Leader on the H-47 Chinook Helicopter Program:
• Manage 20 engineers that design all the wire harnesses on the aircraft using CATIA V5, and provide work
instructions for installing them. 
• Manage cost, schedule, quality, risks, issues, and opportunities for eight domestic and international programs;
budgets range between 4,000 and 32,000 man-hours.
• Align team processes to business strategies and objectives.
• Develop employees and motivate them to perform to their highest ability.
• Hold people accountable that do not meet expectations. 
• Utilize technical knowledge to oversee engineering design, processes and specifications.
• Consistently solve technical problems.

Personal Accomplishments:
• Earned Value Management Silver Medallion Certification.
• Completed the Systems Engineering Leadership Program.
• Transitioned team from 2D Drawings to 3D Model-Based-Definition for Wire Harness Installation for the first
time in the Vertical Lift division, which resulted in significant program savings and quality improvements on
the MH-47G program.
• Developed new metrics to effectively manage cost and quality for team’s performance.
• Developed a master schedule for wiring and equipment design maturity using Microsoft Project, which allows
for timely support of proposals.

• Held interim manager positions for both Wire Design and Equipment Design teams for a total of 6 months in
2014 and 2015, while managing the Wire Installation team.

Team Achievements:
• Team’s cost and quality performance improved >60% between Jan 2013 and Dec 2015. 
•  Implemented  dozens  of  process  improvements  into  our  design  to  improve  quality  and  decrease  cost.
Two  examples  include:  color-coding  wire  harnesses  in  3D  space  to  assist  in  verifying  wiring  separation
requirements,  and  coordinating  new  wiring  disconnect  panels  across  the  air  vehicle  team.  This  increases
commonality between programs and reduces final assembly terminations during the aircraft build in Ridley
Park.

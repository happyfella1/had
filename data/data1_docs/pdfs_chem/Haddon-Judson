Developed "Lean Manufacturing" process for product labeling and label generation
Visibar and Visiwatch (Peoplesoft) integration with FourthShift (Softbrands) ERP/MRP software
Heraeus had a "Manual System" for order processing, manufacturing of products for the order, ordering parts
and materials from suppliers applicable to the order (purchasing), accounting, shipping instructions and label
generation and all paper work necessary for the order automatically sent the appropriate departments. The
paperwork included BOL, invoices, documentation to accounting, internal labels and all paperwork for export.

My function as a change coordination was to design and implement a fully integrated system using ERP and
Lean manufacturing processes. The software was from Peoplesoft and Fourthshift software, mainly, and other
software houses.

The order process followed this frame work: (This was / is all accomplished by the IT system setup for the
process) The process was automated to reduce human error and mismanagement.

Order received and entered into the system (If new customer, a new customer ID was generated and entered
into the system) by customer service.
An invoice was generated. Copies went the warehouse, shipping and receiving, purchasing, manufacturing
and accounting.
The  warehouse  would  pull  the  parts  and  materials  required  for  the  order  fulfillment.  The  pulled  parts  and
materials would be sent to the proper manufacturing workstations. If parts and materials were not on hand,
warehouse would advise purchasing to order the required items for the order.

Manufacturing would assemble the order and send to shipping. If parts and material were not on hand to
complete the order. Manufacturing would advise customer service to inform the customer of the delay.

Shipping would receive the complete or incomplete order and prepare order for shipping. When the order was
actually shipped. Shipping would inform customer service who would then inform the customer.

The  whole  process  is  automated  so  that  customer  service  does  not  actually  contact  the  warehouse,  the
warehouse purchasing, purchasing to manufacturing, etc. When customer service enters the order into the
system, the system automatically sends an email to the various business units advising of the order. At the
same time all labels, paperwork, etc are generating and send to the appropriate printers and labels printers.

The only time there would be any direct communication between the business units would be the failure of a
printer, email not received or anything not in the system, that the system would not be able to handle.

The system was setup as a "sandlot" process to input all customer data, accounting data, warehouse part
numbers, internal part numbers, etc. When the data input was completed, the new system was run parallel
to the old manual system. All failures were corrected and adjustments made to the new system. When I felt
confident that the system was finished, I advise accounting and the upper administration that we were ready
to go live. Accounting and upper admin did their testing. When they were satisfied that the system was ready
to roll out. I was given the go ahead to proceed. There were small glitches that were corrected along the way.

Judson manufactured a multi-shaft synchronizer. Shaft synchronizers coordinate the positions and speed of
various equipment shafts. The original instrument was an analog device and was analog driven.
The commercial name was "Judson Engine Synchronizer"
The  instrument  was  used  for  naval  and  military  usage,  i.e.  multiple  boat  screw  shafts,  multiple  aircraft
screws(propellers). Non-military usage was for commercial and private boats, knitting equipment, weaving
looms, wire looms. And any machinery that required multiple synchronized shafting.

The first phase was to determine the exact analog process to understand how the system functioned.
Then separate the individual components and systems by their function(s).
Each component and system was then described in both actual and in abstract form.
All documentation for the new digital model was generated. This phase included mechanical and electronic
schematics, BOMs', assignment of duties and responsibilities to the various departments and personnel.

The required prototypes were assembled and put through a series of actual real world procedures. Both non-
destructive testing and destructive testing.

The testing phase required mounting on boats, test aircraft, testing looms and environmental testing.
When  the  new  digital  model  met  and  exceded  Mil-Spec  and  commercial  specifications.  The  digital  model
replaced  the  analog  model  in  the  market  place.  Product  was  sold  to  the  Guest  Corp.  (Now  part  of  http://
www.marinco.com/)

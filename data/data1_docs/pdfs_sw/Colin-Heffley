domains that provide situational awareness, "actionable intelligence", and battle command operations. Major
systems and domains supported were IMINT, FMV, MTI, Still Imagery, Geospatial, CHARCS, MFLTS, and
TGS. Provided engineering support to the Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing
Environment (CPCE) V2 and V3 project. Tasks performed included SoS engineering and integration; document
generation and review; capability upgrades and certification, security, and information assurance (IA) support;
test event planning including formal qualification testing (FQT), developmental testing (DT) and operational
testing (OT).

Additional responsibilities:
• Coordinated program activities to facilitate DCGS-A and CPCE system development and testing between
PEO Systems, Programs of Record (PoRs), and Army/DoD departments, i.e. DOT&E, ASA(ALT), TRADOC
etc.
• Acquired knowledge of CPCE current and future applications, widgets and systems to understand how to
architect, design, test, and integrate 
• Provided assistance throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and requirements engineering
• Supported execution of the CPCE COE capabilities strategy and SoS technical solutions through the tiered
systems engineering development/test organizational decision structure
• Reviewed SoS DoDAF architecture products representing the design related to CP CE as well as COE cross
cutting capabilities
• Coordinated stakeholder inputs and development activities to resolve issues and manage cross-program
dependencies
• Produced and reviewed systems engineering and test documents: TEMPs, Continuous
Assessment Strategy (CAS), Verification Strategy, Data Source Matrixes (DSM), System
Engineering plans (SEP), System Specifications, COE Control Point Specifications etc.
• Supported the system engineering process, managed requirements including requirements
analysis, traceability, integration, test and verification, operations concepts and trade studies
through the acquisition lifecycle
• Coordinated with ASA(ALT) and Army C4ISR PoR systems to facilitate interoperability testing

•  Supported  development  efforts  and  testing  of  parallel  and  competing  CPCE  system  baselines  and
incremental releases to meet mission goals, scalability requirements, and allow for flexible system evolution
and agile development all while maintaining legacy applications
• Evaluated plans and schedules for disconnects in software testing and developed closure plans
• Supported change management and risk management activities
• Developed presentations, charts, graphs and reports for design reviews (PDRs, CDRs, and
TRRs) and meetings. Provided systems engineering, test and acquisition support in preparation for program
milestone reviews

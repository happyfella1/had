ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Skills & Abilities
MANAGEMENT
• My experience with Pacific Sunwear has given me a lot of experience managing a team. I was often an acting
manager and in charge of 2-4 associates at a time. My responsibility to make sure they were staying on task
and accomplishing the goals set, as well as assisting customers. By working closely with the associates, I was
able to make sure the day went smoothly.

SALES
•  Because  of  past  experience  in  sales,  I  have  a  very  good  understanding  of  how  sales  and  business
management works. I have had to open and close stores, manage money, and determine sales goals for the
day and week.

COMMUNICATION
• In my previous work experience, it has been necessary to communicate problems that arise in order to solve
them to make the customer happy. By communicating to other co-workers or mangers as soon as possible,
we were able to solve the problem more efficiently. Similarly, by communicating about problems relating to
tasking, we were able to come up with the best solution by collaborating ideas.

TEAMWORK
• I have always been a part of a sales team which has given me the opportunity to develop the skills necessary
to work with other people. I enjoy working together to accomplish goals and give the team a win, no matter
how small. In my education, I have had to work in groups for various projects. One project in particular was a
yearlong research and experimental project. This allowed me to collaborate with the other members to solve
disagreements and complete the project on time.

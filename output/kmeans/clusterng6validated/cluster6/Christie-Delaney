I am a sales associate at Fashion Bug (part time). I have been there since October 15, 2011. I enjoy helping
customers and making sure their experiences are wonderful, so they will come back. I also enjoy helping my
co-workers. (See work experience for a full detail about my position.)

I am interested in a position either full or part time, preferably full time. I would like to be trained as assistant
manager. I am also open to doing clerical work. Being trained for a banking position is also an interest for
me as well.

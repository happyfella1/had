Certified Geriatric Pharmacist
August 2014 to July 2019
The geriatric pharmacist knows that the focus must be on the total patient, looking at all of the diseases and
all of the medicines to evaluate appropriateness of drug therapy. The geriatric pharmacist also knows that
the elderly are subject to conditions, such as falls, delirium, and cognitive impairment, that are not usually a
concern in younger adults. Drug therapy must be evaluated with respect to the potential for medications to
cause or worsen these “geriatric syndromes.”

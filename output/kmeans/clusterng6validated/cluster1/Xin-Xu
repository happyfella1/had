Depth Measurement in Tissue Suing Piezoelectric Sensors Having Different Probe Sizes
(#WO2015105827 A1)

July 2015
An apparatus and method for determining the depth of an object below a surface or the thickness of the dermis.
The apparatus and method use a plurality of piezoelectric fingers having probes with differently sized contact
areas. A plurality of measurements is taken using each of the probes with differently sized contact areas in
order to determine the depth of an object below a surface or the thickness of the dermis.

Systematic Design of a Cross-Polarized Dermoscope for Visual Inspection and Digital
Imaging

inspection-and-digital-imaging
December 2011
A dermoscope is a diagnostic device that can image the skin in situ and is used for early diagnosis of melanoma
and  pigmented  skin  lesions.  In  this  paper,  we  describe  the  design  and  construction  of  a  cross-polarized
dermoscope including the illumination evaluation, imaging design, and the mechanical setup. By using the
cross-polarization dermoscope, specular reflection from the superficial layer of the skin is largely eliminated.
Therefore,  deeper  layers  of  the  skin,  such  as  the  inner  pigments  and  the  capillary  blood  vessels,  can  be
visualized.

Breast Tumor Detection Using Piezoelectric Fingers: First Clinical Report
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1072751513001683
June 2013
We have developed a radiation-free, portable, low-cost detector --Piezoelectric Finger (PEF)-- that does not
require  skilled  interpretation  to  be  used  as  a  first-line  prescreening  test  in  women  who  do  not  receive  the
maximum benefit from mammographic surveillance. This report describes our first clinical experience with this
device.

An electrospun PVDF-TrFe fiber sensor platform for biological applications
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424714004944
November 2014
Flexible,  self-powered  materials  are  in  demand  for  a  multitude  of  applications  such  as  energy  harvesting,
robotic  devices,  and  lab-on-a  chip  medical  diagnostics.  Electrospinning  piezoelectric  fluoropolymers  into
nanofibers can provide these functionalities in a facile method. PVDF-TrFe was electrospun in an aligned
format  and  interfaced  with  a  flexible  plastic  substrate  in  order  to  create  a  platform  for  voltage  response
characterization after small force cantilever deformations. Voltage peak signals were an average of ±0.4V,
and  this  response  did  not  change  after  platform  sterilization.  However,  when  placed  in  cell  culture  media,
piezoelectric  response  was  dampened.  This  platform  can  be  used  for  measurement  and  analysis  of
electromechanical behavior in a variety of applications, including cellular-powered nanodevices

Under review: Development of Array Piezoelectric Fingers towards In Vivo Breast Tumor
Detection
February 2016
We  have  investigated  the  development  of  a  handheld  4×1  piezoelectric  finger  (PEF)  array  breast  tumor
detector system towards in vivo patient testing, particularly, on how the duration of the DC applied voltage, the
depression depth of the handheld unit, and breast density affect the PEF detection sensitivity on 40 patients.

The tests were blinded and carried out in four phases: with DC voltage durations 5, 3, 2, to 0.8 s corresponding
to  scanning  a  quadrant,  a  half,  a  whole  breast,  and  both  breasts  within  30  min,  respectively.  The  results
showed that PEF detection sensitivity was unaffected by shortening the applied voltage duration from 5 to
0.8 s. Nor was it affected by increasing the depression depth from 2 to 6 mm. Over the 40 patients, PEF
detected 46 of the 48 lesions (46/48) --with the smallest lesion detected being 5 mm in size. Of 28 patients with
mammography records, PEF detected 31/33 of all lesions (94%) and 14/15 of malignant lesions (93%) while
mammography detected 30/33 of all lesions (91%) and 12/15 of malignant lesions (80%), indicating that PEF
could detect malignant lesions not detectable by mammography without significantly increasing false positives.
PEF’s detection sensitivity is also shown to be independent of breast density, suggesting that PEF could be a
potential tool for detecting breast cancer in young women and women with dense breasts.

WORK EXPERIENCE

Sr. Staff Engineer
Materials and Processes Engineering, Lockheed Martin Space Systems  -  Newtown, PA - August 1997 to
March 2015

• Lead Materials and Processes Engineer for multiple spacecraft programs for NASA, DoD, Air Force, Navy and
commercial customers; responsible for development, selection and approval of all materials and processes to
insure design, performance and quality objectives are met in the most cost effective manner; provided direct
hands-on support through the entire life cycle of each program, from conceptual design through manufacture,
integration, test and end use; led numerous failure investigations
• Developed and qualified a new antenna sunshield configuration (patent application filed) that reduced weight,
improved antenna performance, and saved hundreds of thousands of dollars on multiple spacecraft
•  Developed  an  electrically-conductive  adhesive  compound  (patent  disclosure  submitted)  for  grounding  of
spacecraft components which saves weight and reduces assembly time and costs
• Developed several processes using low-pressure plasma technology to substantially increase the adhesion
of coatings and adhesives to difficult-to-bond surfaces such as silicone and Teflon
• Led the investigation to determine the cause of on-orbit contamination of several Space Shuttle Camera
lenses; identification of cause and successful implementation of solution received recognition from NASA, a
Letter of Commendation, and a Special Recognition Award
• Received Special Recognition Award for the development of common practices and specifications for PWB
and PWA fabrication that could be used at different company locations; annual cost savings ~ $500,000

Manager
Materials & Processes Engineering, Lockheed Martin Astro Space  -  East Windsor, NJ - 1996 to 1997

• Led a group of ten engineers and two technicians during a difficult period of plant closing, meeting all cost,
schedule and performance objectives for several spacecraft programs
• Lead Materials & Processes Engineer for the ACES satellite; responsibilities included evaluation and approval
of all materials and processes, analytical prediction of on-orbit contamination levels, and production support
to Manufacturing and subcontractors
•  Investigated  the  effects  of  atomic  oxygen  on  materials  in  low  earth  orbit;  co-authored  with  NASA  and
presented a paper, "Effects of Simulated Orbital Atomic Oxygen on Germanium-Coated Kapton Films"

Staff Engineer
Materials and Processes, Lockheed Martin Astro Space  -  East Windsor, NJ - 1994 to 1996

• Provided material and process support as a member of an Integrated Product Team to produce High Voltage
Electronic  Power  Conditioners;  assisted  design  engineers  with  material  and  process  selection,  resolved
manufacturing and quality problems, wrote material and process specifications, and evaluated new materials
• Conducted an investigation to reduce adhesive bonding cycle time for Solid-State Power Amplifier production
which resulted in a reduction in bonding cycle time by over 50%
• Worked on a team to replace an ozone depleting solvent (Freon 113) with an HCFC solvent; effort included
testing to determine cleaning effectiveness as well as compatibility with numerous spacecraft materials

Lead Materials & Processes Engineer for the Earth Observing System Spacecraft
GE Astro Space  -  East Windsor, NJ - 1991 to 1994

• Evaluated and approved all materials and processes, both in-house and subcontractor built; assisted design
engineers with proper material and process selection, and conducted material testing and characterization
• Responsible for $700K budget - all contractual requirements were met on schedule and within budget
• Co-chaired a proactive, multifunctional Engineering/Materials/Manufacturing/Quality (EMMQ) team with over
20 members for 2 years, successfully heading off numerous hardware problems prior to production
• Functioned as technical interface with NASA Goddard Materials Branch; led weekly customer meetings

Senior Materials & Processes Engineer
GE Astro Space  -  Valley Forge, PA - 1989 to 1991

• Established and quantified the chemical mechanism responsible for oxidation of silver by atomic oxygen in
low earth orbit environment; wrote software to predict degradation as a function of time and orbit parameters
• Lead Materials and Processes Engineer for Space Station Attached Payloads Accommodation Equipment
(APAE) program; technical liaison with NASA
• Developed innovative CVD coating process to coat niobium filaments with yttria to prevent welding of filaments
to one another at 1200 degrees C operating temperature; received recognition from JPL customer

Materials Survivability Engineer
GE Astro Space  -  Valley Forge, PA - 1987 to 1989

• Designed and implemented a laser interferometer-based facility for the measurement of coefficient of thermal
expansion (CTE) for very low expansion graphite/epoxy composite materials
• Assisted on a team to design and construct facilities to simulate the combined space environment of solar
UV radiation, vacuum, electrons, and protons, as well as the atomic oxygen environment of low earth orbit
• Quantified the effects of particulate and film-type contamination on the bidirectional reflectance (BRDF) of
low scatter optical surfaces; authored and presented two papers on this topic at conferences

Materials Development Engineer
GE Space Systems Division  -  Valley Forge, PA - 1984 to 1987

• Conducted in-depth characterization of graphite/epoxy composites in the areas of absorption and diffusion
of moisture and thermal expansion for the NASA Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS)
• Developed and qualified high-temperature (1200 degrees C) passive thermal control coatings
• Designed and implemented a facility for measuring CTE of large (>20 feet) composite test specimens
• Developed a computer model to assess the effects of atomic oxygen on several materials in low earth orbit
• Automated existing test equipment and installed data acquisition system for measuring light scatter (BRDF)

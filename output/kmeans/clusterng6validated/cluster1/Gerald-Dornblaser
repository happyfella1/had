Apparatus and Method for Injecting Cryogenic Liquid into Containers (#6,363,729)

April 2002
A compact device for injecting cryogenic liquid into containers is capable of use with containers of varying
sizes. A vessel containing the cryogenic liquid is connected to a nozzle by a thermally-insulated, flexible hose.
The nozzle is connected to an arm which is mounted to a support, such that the arm can move in different
directions relative to the support. The nozzle can thus be moved with three degrees of freedom, and can be
easily positioned over a container to be filled. The apparatus also includes conduits for conveying excess gas
from the vessel into a process controller housing, to keep moisture out of that housing. The nozzle includes
ports which receive gas formed by vaporizing cryogenic liquid from a supply. Gas flowing into these ports can
be used to control the formation of droplets. When heated, such gas can also be used to prevent ice formation
in the nozzle, or to remove ice that has already formed. The device of the present invention will work easily
with nozzles or nozzle orifices of varying sizes, and can be installed in relatively cramped surroundings.

Methods and systems are provided for enhancing the ultraviolet output of a water disinfection apparatus by:
(i) maintaining the source of the UV radiation at a stable operating temperature and, (ii) facilitating an efficient
transfer of microwave energy to the source of the UV radiation.

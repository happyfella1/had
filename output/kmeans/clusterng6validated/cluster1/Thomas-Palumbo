Principal Mechanical Engineer performing design and analyses for a wide range of products
including low and high power devices/subsystems/systems and low and high power
antennas/antenna systems. Applies broad knowledge of mechanical engineering principles,
theories, concepts, practices, and techniques to meet allocated program, system, and cost
requirements. Provides technical expertise and leadership/mentorship to designers, junior
engineers, and other program team members to ensure completion of programs on schedule and
within budget. Performs CAM function including planning, scheduling, EVM evaluating and
reporting, and ETC/EAC analyses. Collaborates with other disciplines including
electrical/antenna engineering, manufacturing, program management, quality, procurement,
R&M Engineering, and sub-contracts to ensure successful execution of programs.

WORK EXPERIENCE

Principal Mechanical Design Engineer
Cobham Defense Electronic Systems  -  Lansdale, PA - 2001 to Present

General Duties:
• Lead mechanical engineer / IPT lead for small to multi-million dollar programs.
Responsibilities include bidding of required labor and material resources, project
planning, earned value management evaluating and reporting, and ensuring program is
executed on schedule and within budget while managing scope
• Involvement in a wide range of projects from initial concept to end use. Involvement
includes proposal, bidding, earned value management, design, analysis, documentation,
testing, production support, and failure analysis by working closely with customers,
suppliers, and program team members (design/drafting, electrical engineering,
manufacturing, program management, test engineering, quality engineering, etc.)
•  Mechanical  design  of  low  and  high  power  electronic  systems,  subsystems,  and  components  (to  include
transmitters, receivers, and antennas) for US military ground,
airborne, and shipboard environments
• Thermal (steady state and transient) and structural (static and dynamic (vibration, shock))
analyses of electronic systems, subsystems, and components for US military ground,
airborne, and shipboard environments
• Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses of liquid chill plates, heat exchangers, air
flow, and liquid submersed bodies
•  Creation  of  specification,  detail,  and  assembly  drawings  for  parts  and  subsystems  of  complex  electronic
attack/warning and antenna systems
•  Collaborating  with  many  different  company  sites  (for  BAE  Systems  and  Cobham)  across  the  country  by
providing mechanical engineering design and analysis
assistance/guidance.  Efforts  include  designing/specifying  cooling  systems,  CFD  analyses,  and  design
services/support for electronic/antenna systems, assemblies, and components.
• Presenting at various design reviews and technical meetings for external and internal
customers. Travel to customer and supplier locations to support programs

Highlighted Program Specific Experience:

• Lead mechanical engineer for solid state replacement of a TWT RF subsystem used in a
high power transmitter on US military fighter/jammer platforms
• Lead Mechanical Engineer for the design of the power distribution system on a military
armored mine protection vehicle
• IPT lead for the design/manufacture/integration of an equipment cooling system. This
effort involved converting the environmental cooling system of a commercial airliner into an air cooling system
for equipment racks that simulated the electronics of a next
generation US fighter aircraft
• Lead mechanical engineer for various programs including the design of an optical/RF
system to be installed into US aircraft; modification of existing US aircraft electronic
attack/protection system to be installed into US Navy surface ships; design of various low and high power RF
modules (hermetic and non-hermetic); design of various high and low
voltage power supply modules, design of various high and low power receive/transmit
antennas
• Lead mechanical engineer for various IRAD programs including the packaging of high
power GaN amplifiers and associated power supplies into a VITA 48.3 liquid flow-thru
module for use in military airborne environments; the design of a Pumped Liquid
Refrigerant  Flow-Thru  Chill  Plate  Module  for  use  in  military  shipboard  applications;  and  the  packaging  of
extremely high heat flux GaN/SiC discrete and MMIC amplifiers
targeted for high reliability operation in harsh/military environments.

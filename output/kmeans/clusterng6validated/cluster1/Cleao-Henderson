My  work  experience  has  dealt  mostly  with  hydraulic  and  propulsion  systems.  I've  had  to  use  some  of  my
physics and electrical background, though I've worked in a mechanical engineering branch. 

I'm interested in trying various fields of engineering and using my knowledge to fulfill different job tasks.

I'm an innovative individual, an efficient learner and I adapt well in group settings. I learn best through hands-
on-experience and I am determined in finding solutions.

WORK EXPERIENCE

Electrical Engineer
NAVSEA  -  Philadelphia, PA - 2012 to Present

Responsibilities
〓 Providing in-pier and underway technical support for both electrical and mechanical installation and testing
of equipment
〓 Utilizing expertise on CPP systems to train sailors on CPP system maintenance procedures
〓 Professionally presenting technical information in writing (e.g., technical reports, messages, memos, letters,
data summaries, sound and relevant recommendations)
〓 Developing and evaluating the adequacy of maintenance procedures and CPP technical

Accomplishments
Trained sailors on maintenance procedures for propulsion and hydraulic systems on various ship classes with
〓  Visited  ships  from  the  LPD-17  USS  San  Antonio  ship  class  and  LHA-6  USS  America  to  oversee  ship
alterations and sea trials as the controllable pitch propeller (CPP) in-service engineering agent (ISEA)
〓 Developed testing & installation procedures for an electrical device selected to resolve un-commanded pitch
issues within the LPD-17 USS San Antonio ship class
〓 Maintained a successful status in the scientist and engineer development program (SEDP), NSWCCD’s
professional development 3-year program, which consisted of quarterly assessment meetings, training plan
write-ups,  technical  reports  and  evaluations  of  on-the-job  experiences,  required  courses,  mentee/mentor
relationship, and career development assignments
〓 Conducted a variety of investigations and analyses requiring the transfer of propulsion controls due to the
obsolescence  condition  of  major  system  in  the  CPP  system  for  the  MCM-1  USS  Avenger  ship  class;  this
investigation incorporated finding potential risks associated and understanding how the newly installed devices
will impact technical documentation, the way-ahead procedures concerning the life cycle of class, and the cost
〓 Facilitated meeting for an extended project concerning a hydraulic oil hammering issue throughout major
CPP piping go into and from the Hydraulic Oil Power Module (HOPM) and the Oil Distribution (OD) Box. branch/
department collaboration to resolve overarching issues impacting multiple ship classes
〓  Utilized  the  DoD  computing  system,  maintenance  engineering  library  server  (MELS),  to  complete
daily  reviews  of  engineering  performance  data  received  from  CPP  ship  sensors  and  submitted  diagnostic
troubleshooting instructions for sailors to perform and resolve issues manuals, which consist of in-depth detail
about the function, purpose, and design of subsystems within the CPP system; the evaluations ensured Sailors

are able to maintain, replace/install, and operate the subsystems in accordance with current and active DoN
requirements, standards, and specifications
〓 Inspecting newly installed or modified equipment, such as valves, piping, and some electrical components,
e.g. an optical isolator, and analyzing systems for conformance to Naval performance requirements
〓 Resolving equipment failure or unsatisfactory performance problems where Sailors are unable to pinpoint
the problem electrically or mechanically; for example, while underway, Sailors are newly learning the system,
so in the case there pitch issues, electrically or mechanically, the CPP ISEA must quickly resolve the matter
〓 Evaluating manufacturers' data packages for devices or components to add or remove from an approved
parts list
〓  Performing  complete  engineering  analyses  for  electrical  and  mechanical  parts  requiring  adaptation  or
extension of the agency standards for such devices to determine whether they are acceptable

Student Trainee

Warfare Center Carderock Division – Ship Systems Engineering Station in Philadelphia, PA
〓  Analyzed  and  improved  various  forms  of  auditing  per  Naval  schematic  and  engineer  specifications
concerning different naval platforms

Research Assistant
ARL - HR&ED, Visual & Audio Branch  -  Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD - August 2009 to June 2011

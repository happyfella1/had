WORK EXPERIENCE

Principal Engineer, Electronics
Abbott Point of Care - In Vitro Imaging Systems  -  Princeton, NJ - April 2009 to Present

Led a team of six engineers to develop the electronics for an imaging-based hematology instrument capable
of  performing  a  Complete  Blood  Count  (CBC)  in  a  Point  of  Care  environment.  Worked  closely  with  other
disciplines, including Mechanical, Software and Optics Engineers, Quality, Regulatory, Marketing and Program
Management.

Projects & Experience:

Electrical Engineering Department Management
* Managed department tasks and priorities for a team of six engineers with experience levels ranging from
Associate to Principal Engineer.
*  Selected  suppliers  for  electronic  components,  including  circuit  boards,  custom  cable  assemblies,  single
board computers, and LCD screens.
* Worked with program management and other engineering groups on project planning and scheduling.
* Collaborated with the Materials, Quality and Regulatory departments to audit vendors, perform verification,
create processes, and identify regulatory requirements.
*  Built  the  Electrical  Engineering  department  infrastructure,  including  setting  up  the  electronics  lab  and
selecting all tools, equipment and development software for the department.

Desktop Hematology Instrument

* Led the Electrical Engineering department to develop all electronics throughout the system, including circuit
board design, touch screen interface and single board computer integration.
* Developed a communication architecture that allowed control of all sensors and actuators throughout the
system via a simple I2C bus.
* Designed the power architecture of the system, integrating it with the power state machine of the embedded
Intel single board computer.
* Identified devices used for operator identification, such as barcode readers and RFID readers.

Instrument Control Circuitry
* Developed circuits to perform tasks related to motion control, data acquisition and microscope illumination.
* Worked with Hardware and Software Engineers to develop algorithms for motion control and blood sample
preparation.

SATA Camera Design
* Managed the development of a single-board camera that could communicate with a PC via a standard SATA
interface. 
* Developed system requirements, such as camera throughput, on-board image processing and cost.
* Worked with contractors to develop the camera, and coordinated with the Embedded Software and Optics
teams on testing and system integration.

Associate Member, Technical Staff
Sarnoff Corporation/SRI International  -  Princeton, NJ - April 2007 to April 2009

Developed cameras, test systems and support electronics for CCD and CMOS imagers. Used FPGAs, high
speed drivers, and DC bias circuits to generate precision timing signals. Digitized high-speed video signals
using correlated double sampling to minimize noise.

Projects:

CCD Camera Design
* Developed a single-board camera to drive an 8k CCD line array for customers to use as an evaluation board
and reference design.
* Tested and debugged the system, including updating the FPGA design and soft-core processor firmware.
* Led the fabrication and testing effort for the first run of production boards.

CMOS Test System Design
* Designed adapter boards to interface with existing test-bed electronics in order to test new CMOS sensors.
* Developed timing schemes and test methods for CMOS sensors.

Iris Recognition System
* Developed system electronics to capture an iris image and transfer it to a computer for image processing.
* Designed circuit for controlling infrared LEDâ€™s used for subject illumination.

Electronics Engineer
Siemens Diagnostics  -  Flanders, NJ - February 2003 to April 2007

Developed electronics for an automated in-vitro diagnostic system for use in large blood testing laboratories.
This was done with distributed microcontrollers controlling over eighty motors and associated sensors and
actuators. 

Projects:

Motion Control Circuitry
* Developed circuit boards from circuit concept to production documentation and bill of materials.
* Design for manufacturability and identify manufacturing test methods and requirements.
* Wrote software for microcontroller to verify design.

Image Processing System
*  Investigated  feasibility  of  using  image  processing  in  order  to  identify  patient  blood  samples  and  gather
information about test tubes (i.e. height, diameter, cap presence).
* Led interdepartmental team to determine requirements for a production version of the system based on
customer needs, system cost, and physical layout.

I2C Network for Reset Control
* Implemented an I2C network to control the reset signals of approximately forty microcontrollers from a master
control PC.
*  Simplified  cable  routing  and  reduced  system  cost  by  reducing  the  number  of  conductors,  overall  cable
diameter, number of circuit boards and total cable length.

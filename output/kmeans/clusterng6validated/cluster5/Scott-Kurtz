DSP Software Engineering
InterDigital Communications Corporation  -  King of Prussia, PA - June 1986 to December 1997

• Developed baseband modem and embedded control software for wireless local loop subscriber and base
station. The technology in InterDigital’s system encompassed groundbreaking technology and was, in fact, the
predecessor to the 3G mobile communications standards.
• Worked on RF modem design, speech compression, waveform coding, telecom systems engineering, and
embedded software development. By being involved in so many aspects of the system, I became a de-facto
systems engineer in the process.

Member, Engineering Staff
Radio Corporation of America (RCA), Government Communications System Division  -  Camden,
NJ - 1983 to 1986

• Developed and implemented a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) modem whose claim to fame is that it could
successfully transmit in the HF radio band at transmit levels that were so low that they could not be detected
above the background noise. 
• Demonstrated transmission over a distance of 300 miles using 2 watts of transmit power using sky-wave
transmission.

October 2006
Voiceband compression techniques are employed in order to enable an RF telecommunications base station to
accommodate data signals of high speed voiceband modems and FAX machines. An Ultra-High Speed Codec
supports voiceband modem and FAX transmissions up to 14.4 kb/s and operates using four 16-phase RF slots.
Because these codecs transmit information over several RF slots which can be contiguous, the slots within
RF communication channels are dynamically allocated. The Dynamic Time slot/Bandwidth Allocation feature
detects and monitors the data transmission and forms a data channel from the necessary number of slots.

A subscriber cluster unit for a wireless telecommunication system provides a wireless interface with a base
station  for  a  plurality  of  subscriber  units.  The  cluster  unit  has  a  plurality  of  frequency  agile  modems  for
processing wireless communications with the base station and a plurality of subscriber line circuits, each for
providing a telecommunication connection with a subscriber unit. A control processor assigns a modem for
each communication between the base station and a selected subscriber unit which is coupled to one of the line
circuits and associates that line circuit with the assigned modem for that communication. Thus, a subscriber
unit coupled with any of the line circuits can communicate with the base station via any of the modems.

Two related voiceband compression techniques are employed in order to enable an RF telecommunications
base  station  to  accommodate  data  signals  of  high  speed  voiceband  modems  and  FAX  machines.  A  High
Speed Codec enables the base station to pass voiceband modem and FAX transmissions at up to 9.6 kb/s.
An Ultra-High Speed Codec supports voiceband modem and FAX transmissions up to 14.4 kb/s. The High
Speed Codec operates using three 16-phase RF slots or four 8-phase RF slots, and the Ultra-High Speed
Codec operates using four 16-phase RF slots. Because these codecs transmit information over several RF
slots which can be contiguous, the slots within RF communication channels are dynamically allocated. The
Dynamic Time slot/Bandwidth Allocation feature detects and monitors the data transmission and forms a data
channel from the necessary number of slots.

A DFT is used to compute the magnitude and phase of the frequencies desired to be detected in a frame
of sampled data by performing 2 dot products for each such frequency. The two dot products are calculated
using the samples in the frame and an equal number of equally spaced cosine and sine coefficients for each
frequency to be detected.

A  telecommunication  system  and  method  for  communicating  communication  signals  between  various
stations over a selected carrier medium. An improved encoder and method is provided for compressing a
communication signal into a selectively formatted encoded signal to facilitate its transmission over the selected
carrier  medium.  The  method  is  particularly  useful  for  encoding  fax  and  modem  data  signals  which  do  not
exhibit the harmonics of a voice signal. A decoder and method for reconstruction of the encoded signal are
also provided.

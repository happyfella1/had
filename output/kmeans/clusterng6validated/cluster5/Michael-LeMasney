WORK EXPERIENCE

Systems & Software Engineer
Lockheed Martin  -  Moorestown, NJ - February 1998 to Present

[Contract assignment through Keystone Computer Associates]

• Served as the lead software engineer for a major version of an interface simulation program, leading a team
of 12+ engineers to deliver the high visibility program on time and within budget. This position involved weekly
meetings with upper management and the leads of other programs to provide status updates, plan work, track
budgets, and discuss potential problems and upcoming milestones.

• Served as the responsible engineer for one of the four major components of an interface simulation program,
coordinating  efforts  of  up  to  3  other  engineers,  and  performing  configuration  management  tasks  including
managing code libraries, building test loads, preparing official build requests, and providing status updates to
upper management.

• Most recently worked on the team designing and developing the Aegis Ashore Tactical Trainer, which will be
used to train sailors at the Aegis Ashore installations around the world.

•  Wrote  software  requirements  based  on  high-level  customer  requirements,  reviewed  the  development
supporting those requirements, wrote Functional Test plans and procedures, and executed those procedures
to verify that all requirements have been met.

• Used object-oriented programming in C++ and Java, following a CMMI Level 5 process that stressed reuse
of  existing  code,  early  detection  and  removal  of  defects,  and  the  importance  of  requirements  traceability
throughout development and testing.

• Designed, coded, tested, documented, and performed configuration management for two real-time multi-
threaded interface simulation programs used to test the Aegis Weapon System.

• Extended the life of an older generation program during development of a newer generation program by
connecting the two systems via a TCP/IP client/server interface and leveraging the capabilities of the older
program until those capabilities were available in the newer program. This allowed us to use the new features
of the newer program to participate in a series of large-scale test events on a nationwide distributed network
of military simulations.

• Became the subject matter expert for the simulation program’s interceptor missile model.

• Conceived and implemented a scripting capability in the interceptor missile model to facilitate more complete
unit testing in a less expensive lab environment.

SYSCON  -  Dahlgren, VA - December 1991 to February 1998

[Contract assignment through Keystone Computer Associates]

•  Designed,  coded,  tested,  documented,  and  performed  configuration  management  for  a  real-time  multi-
threaded interface simulation program used to test the Aegis Weapon System.

• Wrote test procedures and test plans, and executed those tests to verify that requirements had been met in
software that had been delivered to the NSWC naval facility.

Software Engineer
General Electric  -  Moorestown, NJ - June 1990 to December 1991

[Contract assignment through Keystone Computer Associates]

•  Designed,  coded,  tested,  documented,  and  performed  configuration  management  for  a  real-time  multi-
threaded interface simulation program used to test the Aegis Weapon System.

• Implemented a capability that allowed up to three simulation computers to be remotely loaded by one master
computer, reducing errors in loading, and making testing more productive by reducing the amount of manual
setup needed to prepare the test suite.

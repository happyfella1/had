I am Pradyumna Ingle, pursuing master’s in Computer Engineering at Drexel University. So far I have studied
master’s level courses like Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Software Development. Also, I am
also getting ready to participate in Linux open source community by participating in Eudyptula challenge set
by Linux foundation. I am looking for co-op/internship opportunities in the field of Embedded Systems and
Operating Systems.

I have worked as a Software Developer in Atos India Pvt. Ltd (Ex- Siemens IT Solutions). For total 3.7 years
of tenure, I have developed Bluetooth connectivity solutions for in-car infotainment systems and developed
mathematical libraries for AUTOSAR. I have learnt basics of Bluetooth protocols and profiles, RTOS and usage
of debuggers during the tenure.

Please visit my LinkedIn profile for more details about my academic projects.

Thank you.

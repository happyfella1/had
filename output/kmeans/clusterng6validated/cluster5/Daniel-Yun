waveforms on various test points on the FPGA.

PROJECTS
[Intro to Engineering Design] Designed and prototyped a digital speedometer to read the speed that a vehicle
is traveling and the distance it traveled. Code was developed in C and downloaded onto a microprocessor.
Sensor strips were attached to the wheel, and the code's function counted each revolution of the wheel to
determine the speed that the vehicle was traveling and the distance it traveled.

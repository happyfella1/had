My core capabilities consist of IT staff management, career guidance, interviewing/hiring personnel, vendor
management,  facilities  management,  asset  management,  new  employee  orientation,  procedure/product
implementation,  project  management,  business  recovery  and  documentation.  I  have  been  doing  some  IT
consulting work since early 2014 and am looking to get back into the workforce on a fulltime basis or in a
contract/consulting role. I feel that my experience in the Call Center/Helpdesk arena would be beneficial to an
organization that is looking to improve the staff's overall call resolution/performance as well as guidance for
implementing consistent policies. I am a competent, dependable, organized and self-motivated individual who
has advanced his career with numerous promotions within the same organization.

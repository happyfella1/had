Embedded Software Engineer
GE Transportation  -  Erie, PA - May 2014 to May 2015

Responsibilities
Continuation of Trip Optimizer project described below.

Embedded Software Engineer
GENERAL ELECTRIC Transportation  -  Erie, PA - February 2013 to February 2014

Trip Optimizer is an intelligent, fuel-saving cruise control for locomotive that optimizes fuel consumption based
on a specific train’s make up and the route traveled. The System calculates the most efficient operation by
considering such factors as train length, weight, grade, track conditions, weather and locomotive performance.
The trip’s profile is updated continuously through a complex network of on-board computers, GPS systems and
advanced algorithms that make adjustments, enabling the train to use less fuel while maintaining smooth train.
The main purpose of this algorithm is to control the locomotive in an automated manner that optimizes for
fuel efficiency. The Trip Optimizer is also added with new Interface called Locomotive Command and Control
Module (LCCM) and use LCCM through the M-9155 network protocol [1] for all its locomotive information and
governing needs. Prior to the advent of LCCM, TO interfaced with locomotive hardware through a miscellany
of mechanisms including CPO, shared memory, serial-port comms, and discrete I/O. The key features of TO
are Automatic throttle and dynamic brake control, Builds individual plan for each train over a given territory,
Improved  and  consistent  train  handling,  Eliminates  over  Speeding,  Provides  auto  independent  Distributed
Power control, EPA certified advanced energy management system and Increasing footprint.

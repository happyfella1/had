WORK EXPERIENCE

Electrical Engineer
ALTRAN  -  Cranbury, NJ - 2012 to 2013

Determined AC station service transformer and corresponding HV fuse requirements for 11kV, 34.5kV and
115kV substations in accordance with IEEE Standards.
• Provided corresponding calculation reports outlining reasoning for the recommendations.
• Provided DC battery calculations for 11kV, 34.5kV, 115kV substations in accordance with IEEE Standards
with corresponding reports.
• Provided conceptual physical layouts of equipment cabling, trenches, and conduit design for both above
ground and below ground facilities.
• Design interfaces between multiple vendors equipment for substations relay communications for protection
and control.
• Updated portions of schematics for high voltage breaker upgrades on single line, elementary, and wiring
diagrams.
• Determine AC and DC panel layout and load balancing.
• Contacted manufactures for technical data sheets to support client requests to meet schedule requirements.
• Calculated lightning protection calculation of substations following IEEE-998 standards
• Determine substation grid grounding requirement per IEEE-80 standards.

Systems Integration Engineer
LOCKHEED MARTIN  -  Moorestown, NJ - 2004 to 2010

Designed and tested switching configuration networks in support of Combat System Engineering Development
Site (CSEDS). Resolving hardware and software system integration issues
• Developed production process diagnostic burn-in test procedures. Change management resulted in improved
quality of SUN Enterprise Servers prior to implementation aboard ship. Unix scripts used to cycle sub system
units during testing

• Prepared Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to facilitate the transition away from legacy rack-based
systems and provide software certification.
• Liaison with technical design authority for AEGIS, NAVSEA, and SPAWAR programs.
• Development/review of Installation Control Diagrams and Interface Requirement Specifications.
• Resolved design issues on Cruise Missile and Naval Mission Planning Systems in support of the Navy.
• Certified NAVSEA Reliability Centered Maintenance(RCM) and Level II certification for Planned Maintenance
System (PMS).

Design/Test Engineer
LOCKHEED MARTIN - 1997 to 2004

Evaluator and performance analyst for Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) products installation, performance
verification and procurement.
• System integrator, providing testing and performance verification for Command, Control, Communications,
Computers and Intelligence(C4I) for Defense Electronic Systems.
• Produced MTBF reports while performing benchmarking and application performance analysis. Presented
results to SPAWAR with recommendations on higher rated components which resulted in improved MTBF
rates and lower cost to the government.
• Redesigned environmental controls in the rack and prepared test procedures to validate that the hardware
was performing with spec with the required redundancy to survive a power failure.
•  Provided  onboard  live  testing  to  validate  that  the  environment  and  infrastructure  performed  within
specifications to limit system shut-downs.
• Planned, reviewed and documented Shock / EMI / shielding (MIL-STD-810E) live tests onboard ship. Provided
on-call support, focused on isolating and resolving network outages.

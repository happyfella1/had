WORK EXPERIENCE

Hardware Design Engineer
MEI  -  West Chester, PA - January 2011 to Present

• Design and development embedded hardware system for electronic bill acceptors,
coin mechanisms and other unattended transaction systems. Hardware development for low noise / high speed
data acquisition which involves with analog/digital
circuits, A/D, D/A, active filters, op-amp, transistor based amplifier, optocoupler, and DC motor control.
• Design for environmental and electrical stress such as temperature, ESD, and EMI.
• Schematic capture and PCB layout support.

Senior Electrical Engineer
ACI Technologies, Inc  -  Philadelphia, PA - August 2000 to May 2010

• Technical lead on the design/ruggedization of avionic audio systems for the Department of Defense (DoD),
US Navy and US Army.
• Involved in the re-designing of US Army survivor radio ARS6-A. Created all the schematics for ARS6-A re-
design including RF, analog, and digital sections. Responsible for the prototype testing and debugging.
•  Re-designed  1960's  obsolete  communication  system  controller  C6533/ARC  for  the  US  Army  Chinook
and Blackhawk helicopters. Implemented corrective actions and conducted environmental, EMI, and power
requirement testing, as well as prototype field testing in-platform, for form, fit, function, and airworthiness.
• Participated in the re-designing of obsolete airfield AN/TRN-30 beacon radio set and AN/ARS-6(V) UHF
Receiver/Transmitter radio by using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts that had increased capability
and lowered total ownership costs.
• Conducted environmental MIL-STD-810, EMI MIL-STD-461, and power requirement MIL-STD-704 testing
for various equipments as well as critical stress and other EMC/EMI evaluations.
• Responsible for CAD schematic capture and PCB layout for most of ACI's engineering projects. Provided
guidance, support, and directions to PCB layout personnel.
• Wrote technical articles for ACIT and EMPFasis, the U.S. Navy's National Center of Excellence.

Electrical Engineer
Environ Products  -  Exton, PA - May 1999 to June 2000

• Designed, configured, and tested motor controlled water level sensor circuit used in residential wastewater
collection tank.
• Designed, tested, and wrote source codes for embedded software/hardware systems.
•  Responsible  for  schematic  capture  /  printed  circuit  board  layout  of  various  mixed  analog/digital  boards
including through-hole and multilayer surface mount.

Electrical Engineer, Simco
Static Control and Cleanroom Products  -  Hatfield, PA - May 1997 to May 1999

• Designed high voltage/low current power supplies and test fixtures.
• Tested, troubleshot, and repaired analog/digital circuit boards.
• Troubleshot and modified source codes for embedded microcontroller systems.
• Investigated, analyzed failures, recommended corrective actions, implemented changes on PCBs, built and
tested prototype PCBs, and updated documents for the official release.

Drexel Design Project
Chameleon Polychromatic Guitar Tuning System (Chameleon LLC)
During this year long project I invented a propriety method of Signal Processing to capture and alter an electric
guitar signal frequency in real time. In normal operation the guitar strings are tightened to a tension known to
produce a specific frequency set (i.e. the 'standard' tuning). If a different tuning is required the string tensions
must be adjusted manually. The device captures the 'standard' frequency signal and outputs a signal with a
different frequency. This allows the guitarist to change tunings without ever physically adjusting the tension
on the guitar strings.

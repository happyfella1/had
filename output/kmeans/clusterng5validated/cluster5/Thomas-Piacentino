WORK EXPERIENCE

Electrical Engineer
Lincoln Drive West  -  Ambler, PA - August 2015

Dear Stafford Bandlow Engineering,
I learned of your posting for an Electrical Engineer through Indeed job search. I am very interested in the field
of Electrical Power and Systems Engineering and would greatly appreciate consideration for such a position. I
am currently employed in the field of Compliance Engineering but am actively seeking a change of paths into
the field of Power and Systems Engineering.
I  strongly  feel  my  current  position  as  a  Product  Compliance  Specialist  demonstrates  many  of  my  natural
abilities. I have been able to excel in this position becoming a crucial part of the Compliance team despite
an unfortunate lack of genuine interest. This position has to improve my time management and productivity
abilities.  It  has  also  provided  me  with  valuable  experience  interacting  with  Electrical/Mechanical/Software
Engineers, Business groups, and customers simultaneously. Further details of my position at ARRIS can be
seen in my résumé.

Sincerely,

EDUCATION

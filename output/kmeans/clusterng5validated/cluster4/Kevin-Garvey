ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I  am  a  new  graduate  from  the  University  of  Rhode  Island  -  College  of  Pharmacy  who  is  self-motivated,
personable, and incredibly hard working. 

In conjunction with my College of Pharmacy curriculum, I also held a part-time position at CVS which I feel
contributed immensely in developing the essential skills all pharmacists must utilize on a daily basis. Over six
years of employment I became fluent not only in accurately processing prescriptions, but also in various other
facets which many companies would consider as desirable. The particular CVS that I worked at was very high
volume, as we processed nearly 500 scripts on a daily basis. Thus, the workload was rather immense and the
environment was incredibly demanding and fast paced. By working in an atmosphere such as this I was able
to cultivate strong prioritizing, multi-tasking, and problem-solving skills. 

During my final year of pharmacy school I was lucky enough to be placed at several Experiential Learning
locations  which  afforded  me  excellent  opportunities  to  accrue  significant  experience.  My  Managed  Care
rotation at Neighborhood Health of Rhode Island developed my abilities to research and provide informative
evidence based answers to any physician questions that may have arose, while my time in three different
Rhode  Island  hospitals  expanded  my  ability  to  offer  patient  specific  input  to  providers  in  a  fast-paced,
demanding environment. These acquired skills are complemented by my ability to collaborate with providers
and coworkers alike. While I worked hard over six years to develop a strong pharmaceutical knowledge and
skills base, I have always felt that my ability to meaningfully interact with other individuals has been my strong
point.

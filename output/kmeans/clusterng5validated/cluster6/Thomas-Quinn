I am currently enrolled at Drexel University pursuing my undergraduate degree in Biomaterials and Tissue
Engineering.  I  have  been  given  the  opportunity  to  work  with  a  wide  array  of  companies  in  the  field,  from
start-up research businesses to reputable and established medical corporations. My focus has primarily been
the applications of and research in biomaterials technology. I am currently searching for an employer who
would provide training and exposure to drug delivery systems, stem cell applications, vaccine research and
development, or regenerative medicine. After several years in the field, I am contemplating returning to school
in order to obtain an M.S., Ph.D., or possibly an M.D. to expand my career opportunities and further enhance
my understanding of human physiology and pathology, healthcare systems, and/or medical devices.

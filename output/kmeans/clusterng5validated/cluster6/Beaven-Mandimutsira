PATENTS

“Process  for  making  Titanium-MWW  zeolite  (#Patent  Application  Publication  #US
2011/0190517 A1, Pub. Date : August 4 2011)
August 2011
Titanium-MWW zeolite is prepared by heating a gel formed from a titanium compound, a silicon source, a
boron source, an MWW-templating agent, and water at a temperature in the range of 35° C. to 75° C. for a
period of 8 to 30 hours to form a pre-crystallized gel, and heating the pre-crystallized gel to a temperature in
the range of 160° C. to 190° C. for a period of 5 or more days to form the titanium-MWW zeolite. The zeolite,
after it is contacted with an acid, is useful in olefin epoxidation with hydrogen peroxide.

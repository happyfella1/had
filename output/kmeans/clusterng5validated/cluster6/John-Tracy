WORK EXPERIENCE

Senior Engineer
MERCK  -  West Point, PA - 2009 to Present

· Worked with Quality Approver to author high quality GMP investigations within the Varicella Manufacturing
Operations, while adhering to safety and compliance practices.
·  Performed  investigations  on  equipment  failures  to  determine  causation:  either  human  or  mechanical.
Implemented viable corrective actions, including, but not limited to new equipment or increased maintenance.
· During a recurring failure investigation of end caps, I determined the causation to be a slight variation of
grove width amongst different manufacturers, which had gone unnoticed for quite some time. When a cap
failed, the entire batch was lost. I recommended and implemented revised specifications for the end caps.
When the end caps not within the revised specifications were discarded or no longer purchased, the failure
rate dramatically dropped.
· Investigated major processing equipment failure such as process vessels, valves, heat exchangers, pumps,
tubing, process filters, flow meters, temperature probes, sonicators and gaskets. Used Root Cause Failure
Analysis  and  Failure  Mode  &  Effects  Analysis  and  appropriate  specification  (ASME,  ASNI)  to  determine
causation of failures and worked with internal and external experts in developing proper corrective actions.

Chemical Process & Coatings Manager
ALLIED TUBE AND CONDUIT  -  Philadelphia, PA - 2006 to 2009

· Managed a three-shift operation of fifteen employees including two supervisors in a union ISO environment.
· Maintained accuracy and ordering of departmental inventory of $6,000,000.
·  Implemented  in-process  improvements  to:  increase  productivity,  reduce  material  losses  and  decrease
downtime.
·  Researched,  specified  and  purchased  new  processing  equipment  to  reduce  the  process  variation  of  the
chemical tanks and increase productivity by decreasing out of spec items.
· Coordinated with engineering department to update process for efficiency and to evaluate new equipment.
· Managed production, with the mill-manufacturing department, to reduce downtime by ensuring the department
was set up to produce new product without interruption.
·  Coordinated  all  departmental  maintenance  issues  with  the  maintenance  department  and  engineering  to
ensure equipment was working adequately and designed equipment to create efficiencies. 
· Managed all HR issues including counseling with union associates to ensure policies were met.
· Recognized, through troubleshooting, that bellows were cracking at an unusually higher rate. Worked with the
manufacturer to determine the issue, which was a specification change on their end. With the manufacturer,
I also worked for my company to receive compensation for the issue that arose due to miscommunication on
their end. 
·  Investigated  major  processing  equipment  failure  such  as  positive  transfer  pumps  freezing,  tank  mixers,
blowers, vacuum systems, transfer lines, process filters clogging, tank heaters, and air dryers. Used Root
Cause Failure Analysis and Failure Mode & Effects Analysis and appropriate specification (ASME, ASNI) to
determine causation of failures and worked with internal and external subject mater experts in developing and
implementing corrective actions. Installed double redundant systems when it was deemed necessary based
decreasing down time. Developed a preventive maintenance program for all processing equipment. 

· Recommend modifying equipment for Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) to reduce downtime and to
eliminate the maintenance mechanic’s required involment with changeovers and replacing equimpment that
failed during processing.
· Recommended and implemented an increased preventative maintenance schedule due to the change in
specifications.
· Recognized an issue with air quality causing pumps to freeze, performed investigation into the root cause
and then researched and purchased an air dryer and pumps with new specifications, that I specified, which
would eliminate the issue.

Supervisor, Downstream Purification Group

• Managed purification using: chromatography columns, UV detectors and flow meters.
• Conducted ultra-filtration and dia-filtration of biopharmaceutical proteins.
• Supervised the relabeling of all process and equipment in two production suites to ensure that all equipment
was properly labeled and there were no discrepancies between SOPs and process diagrams.
• Member of safety committee and coordinated safety training.
•  Recommended,  developed  and  implemented  numerous  process  and  safety  improvements.  Including
designing an improvement to the process transfer panels to increase the safety of employees.

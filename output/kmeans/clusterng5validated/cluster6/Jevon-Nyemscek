Biomaterials Senior Project Engineer with extensive R&D, project management,
production, quality, and regulatory experience.

Brookhaven, PA - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Jevon-Nyemscek/da76ea87f9b089af

I've been involved in medical device development (resorbable polymer bone grafts) from concept to launch on
multiple projects including feasibility, production development from bench to scale up, process and equipment
validation, quality control test development, regulatory approvals including 510k, IDE, and CE. and product
management  following  launch  including  forecasting,  marketing  material  development,  sales  training,  and
surgeon feedback.

I'm  looking  for  an  opportunity  to  apply  my  engineering  and  project  management  skills,  knowledge,  and
experience  to  the  design  and  development  of  medical  devices.  I  have  an  extensive  knowledge  of  bone
graft  implants  and  resorbable  polymers.  My  main  interests  are  in  resorbable  polymers,bone  grafts,  and
cardiovascular devices.

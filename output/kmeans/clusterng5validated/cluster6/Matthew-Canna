• Coordinated efforts and resources between two symbiotic companies, Medcomp is the clinical and research
and development division, and Martech is OEM manufacture division.

Project Engineer duties/roles(Medcomp):
• Prepared and authored all documentation for a clinical and compliance relevance to support thorough product
design.
• Maintained (DHF) Device History File for the life of the project: this includes core inception to final release
to market.
• Adhering to the latest standards ISO 9001 and ISO 13485, I developed quality management for various
devices and processes
• Consulted with ASTM and the FDA to develop a logical Verification and Validation plan for single device
and/or full kits.
o  This  includes  authoring  Lab  Book  Studies,  and  V  and  V  Protocols  used  to  support  510K  submission  of
various product lines.
o  Instructed  key  laboratory  personnel  on  how  to  test  and  evaluate  benchmark  testing  and  simulated  use
validations.
o Developed protocols to evaluate the human factors associated with each unique device.
o Post testing I would summarize and conclude testing I had conducted, to document in the DHF and use
for FDA submission
o Coordinated shipping and packaging tests with outside and internal resources to conform to the latest ISTA
shipping standards, to ensure a quality product reaches the end user.
• Using ISO 10993 Biocompatibility standards I would select and test a products safety for human safety and
efficacy.
o In parallel efforts I would coordinate with outside resources to establish suitable, safe and the best method
to sterilize final kit form of product
o  Sterility  processes  familiar  with  include  ETO(Ethelyne  Oxide),  Gamma  radiation,  heat  and  or  autoclave
options.
• Using Solid Works authored and refined drawings and models of various products and tools for manufacture
and production.
o Includes detailed drawings for the individual component level as well as final bill of material for a completed
kit (tray) the end user would recieve.
• Provided on demand evaluations on various products to answer in field complaints to support the sales and
marketing team.
• Networked with outside vendors to validate vendor processes to certify compliance with FDA standards.
• Contributed to creation of various white paper documents to show clinical advantage of a single or grouping

repeatable product.
• Refined and authored quality assurance procedures to inspect and verify assembled product to enhance
quality and produce the best possible product to the end user.
• Executed and Authored Install Qualifications (IQ) on new and existing machinery to verify a machine was up
to ISO 9001 standards before a product could be assembled.
• Developed and established operational(OQ) windows for a variety of processes to enhance the quality of
the products for the end user.
• Well versed in manual and fully automated processes and tooling to ease in the assembly and construction
of various products.
o Including UV light cure gluing operations, EFD dispensers, 2 part epoxy dispensing units, rotary application
devices, enhanced vision systems, logic controlled automation, and robust mechanical assembly devices
• Troubleshot existing machines and processes (PQ) to enhance the repeatability of products.
• Use (FMEA) root cause analysis to assess design flaws to minimize scrap rates of product.
•  Use  inline  risk  analysis(CAPA)  to  address  production  concerns  and  apply  controls  to  minimize  risk  of
producing a defective product.
• Towards the completion of a product I would author and institute a Quality Assurance Procedure, to assure
final product is delivered to the end user.
• Exercising lean and six sigma principles I would routinely look towards improvement on any of the processes
associated with a design or even evaluate the design itself for ease assembly.
• Coordinated transfer of assembly and quality procedures between national and international facilities.
o Includes the instruction and training of factory workers to assemble single components and full kit designs.
o Includes the migration of quality and inspection procedures from one facility to another.
o Documents the new installation of new tooling, machines, or fixtures used to build up final product.
• Acquired injection and extrusion molding experience to apply to plastic products to enhance quality to the
end user.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I  am  an  IT  professional  possessing  a  Master's  degree  in  Network  and  Communications  Management,
specializing in Security. I feel that my skills align with the position being offered by your company. I am an
accomplished and well-versed technician adept at directing the design, implementation, testing, debugging and
maintenance of equipment while ensuring compliance with stringent time constraints. I am currently seeking
a position that will effectively utilize all of my skills, abilities, and areas of expertise. 
Taking initiative has always been a primary focus of mine, both academically and throughout my career. I
certainly understand the concept of responsibility, holding an intense work ethic and striving to do my best

in any situation. During over 15 years of work experience, I have enthusiastically sought challenging projects
and have made strong contributions to the companies I have been hired by. Highlights include the following:
• Exceptional problem solving, communication, organization and time management skills.
•  Full  lifecycle  experience  in  scoping,  designing,  developing,  and  supporting  enterprise-scale  business
applications and business intelligence software. 
• Unique competency in translating business problems into technical solutions, including technical leadership
and coordination, and ensuring customer needs are met. 
•  Outstanding  leadership  abilities:  able  to  coordinate  and  direct  all  phases  of  project-based  efforts  while
implementing efficient customer support initiatives. 
• Was able to convert in-house MSP utility servers (e.g., Kaseya and LabTech) into fully functional, easy-to-
manage tools, improving them from suboptimal functionality. 
My technical and business background is enriched by the following certifications: CompTIA A+, MCSA, MCITP,
and MCSAM. Having the ability to quickly grasp business and technology concepts and being able to think
creatively  has  granted  me  much  success.  I  have  an  intense  interest  in  pursuing  and  overcoming  difficult
challenges and previous employers have recognized my hard work in the form of positive performance reviews
and an award for MVP of the North East Coast (while at Siemens). I have the drive to make a difference.
I'd like to meet with you and discuss how I can contribute my experience, skills and dedication. I can be reached
at […] and look forward to speaking with you.

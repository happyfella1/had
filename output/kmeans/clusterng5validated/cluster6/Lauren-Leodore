WORK EXPERIENCE

Coatings Production Engineer
Biocoat, Inc  -  Horsham, PA - May 2014 to Present

Successfully implemented Delta V automation software to reduce operator variability when running reactors.
The  addition  of  engineering  controls  reduced  the  risk  for  out  of  specification  batches;  therefore,  keeping
production on schedule.
* Developed reactor cleaning method in order to utilize multiple reactors for different products without risk of
product contamination.
* Decreased batch analysis time by 2 hours by introducing a microwave moisture analyzer to determine solids
contents in all coatings products.
* Designed and implemented a dual shaft high shear agitation impeller to decrease batch mixing time by 12
hours; therefore, increasing productivity.
* Reduced use of process water by implementing the use of a recirculating chiller unit to cool reactors.
* Project lead in reactor scale-up project. Successfully designed and calculated heat transfer requirements
for a 50L reactor.
* Interfaced with several contractors and assisted in building design meetings for a new production facility.
* Developed chemical waste procedure to comply with OSHA regulations
* Excellent process validation skills
* Trained operators on all new equipment
* Fill-in supervisor as needed

Process Engineer II
Ashland, Inc  -  Philadelphia, PA - March 2013 to May 2014

Championed  a  capital  project  to  replace  existing  inhibitor  dispensing  pumps  with  air  diaphragm  pumps  to
reduce chance of injury and improve ease of operation.
* Successfully worked with production supervisors/operators to achieve over 100 days without a late shipment.
*  Developed  method  for  loading  tankwagons  that  meet  customer  specifications  without  requiring  lab
adjustments.
* Member of ergonomic assessment team that meets quarterly and focuses on processes that score high on
BRIEF/BEST forms.
* Track batch cycle times and identify points of loss and correct to prevent production downtime.
* Investigate all off spec and late shipments and identify root causes and corrective actions.
* Assist in annual production shutdown by participating in lock-out/tag-out and administering hot work and
confined space entry permits.
* Audit chemical waste area and inspected waste drums weekly. All out of compliance waste drums were
corrected by the end of shift.
*  Member  of  plant  management  team  with  active  involvement  in  weekly  leadership  meetings  where  plant
improvement initiatives were discussed.
* Back-up production supervisor (nightshift and weekends included)

and cost effectiveness of plant operations.
* Provide engineering support and process, mechanical, and instrumentation troubleshooting necessary to
meet all production/customer requirements.
* Actively participate in Lean Manufacturing Initiatives such as A3 investigations and 5S implementations.
*  Strong  ability  to  identify  where  a  process  requires  standardization  via  statistical  analysis  and  in  order  to
improve plant processes.
* Oversee the activities of four chemical operators in order to ensure that training of newly installed processes
is executed successfully and that new equipment is running smoothly.
* Supervise production when needed

Refining Technical Specialist
* Aided internal refinery in engineering a metal scavenging flow column which recovers 30TO metal per month.
*  Present  at  customer  sites  (both  internally  and  externally)  throughout  North  America  to  educate  both
Pharmaceutical and Manufacturing facilities about the benefits of implementing metal scavengers
* Screen both internal and external product/waste streams to help engineer the best plant sized scavenging
set-up and to show customers how much metal they are losing each year in TO and dollars
*  Travel  to  customer  sites  and  supervise  equipment  installation  while  instructing  operators  how  to  use
scavengers properly for optimum performance
* Supervise two on-site chemical operators to ensure that internal scavenging column is properly functioning

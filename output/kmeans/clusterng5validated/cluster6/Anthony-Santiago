When I was a kid I always enjoyed building things and learning how technologies worked. This was especially
true when I discovered the Source Engine through Half-Life 2 and Garry's Mod 9.0.4 at the age of 10. I quickly
became immersed in Source SDK and started creating maps for the Source Engine.

If we fast forward to modern day, I basically do the same thing except with code. Like level design, code is
a work of art; it tells a story.

0 months into programming I learned the basics of Java and Object Oriented Programming through Oracle's
Java Tutorials. To get the most out of my learning, I set off to build a simple musical scale viewer, which would
eventually turn into a small scale Swing application.
6  months  in  I  had  the  knowledge  to  create  an  encryption  algorithm,  convert  Swing  UI  to  JavaFX  UI,  and
understand many Object Oriented Programming concepts on a deep level such as Polymorphism. By this time
I had also experimented with several other languages such as JavaScript, Lua, C, C++, and Ruby.
12 months in I had successfully created a mobile game using Unity3D and C# that utilized in-app purchases,
leaderboards, and achievements. By this time I had experimented with native Android applications. This also
marks my transition from simply sitting down and coding to planning things out using UML.
18 months in I enrolled in the Android Developer Nanodegree even though I did not meet the pre-requesite
for having 2 years of Java experience. By this time I had experimented with low level concepts using x86
assembler and basic RISC assembler.
24 months in I completed the Android Developer Nanodegree with most projects "exceeding specifications".
For my final project I wrote a basic x86 Assembly simulator that teaches programming. At this point I started
to transition to using unit testing.

Present day, I still have the mindset to learn something new each and everyday. I aim to create quality software
where ever my path takes me.
